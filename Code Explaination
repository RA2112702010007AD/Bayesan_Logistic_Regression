# **Code Explaination**
It generates synthetic data, defines a prior distribution, and samples from the posterior distribution of the model parameters. Let's break down the code step by step and explain its components:

1. **Import Libraries**: The code starts by importing the necessary libraries:

   - `numpy` (as `np`): For numerical operations.
   - `scipy.stats.norm`: For the normal distribution (used for the prior).
   - `matplotlib.pyplot` (as `plt`): For data visualization.

2. **Sample Dataset**: A small sample dataset `X` and binary labels `y` are created. `X` is a 2D array where each row represents a data point with two features. `y` contains binary labels (0 or 1).

3. **Prior**: A prior distribution for the model parameters is defined. In this case, a multivariate normal distribution is used with mean vector `prior_mu` initialized as zeros and covariance matrix `prior_sigma` initialized as the identity matrix. This represents the prior beliefs about the model parameters.

4. **Logistic Function**: The `logistic` function defines the logistic sigmoid function, which is used to model the probability of a binary outcome as a function of a linear combination of features.

5. **Likelihood**: The `likelihood` function computes the likelihood of the observed data given the model parameters. It calculates the log-likelihood for each data point and sums them up. This is the likelihood component of the Bayesian logistic regression model.

6. **Sample from Posterior**: In this section, samples are drawn from the posterior distribution of the model parameters. This is done using a Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling approach. A loop runs for `N` iterations, and at each iteration, a sample is drawn from the posterior distribution and stored in the `samples` array.

7. **Plot Samples**: The code visualizes the samples obtained from the posterior distribution by creating a scatter plot in the parameter space (w1 and w2). The `alpha=0.1` argument makes the points semi-transparent.

8. **Print Message**: Finally, a message is printed to indicate that Bayesian logistic regression has been implemented and visualized.

This code demonstrates a basic example of Bayesian logistic regression, where you're exploring the posterior distribution of model parameters.
