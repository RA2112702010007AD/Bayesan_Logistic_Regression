- X is the input dataset with 4 examples of 2 features each
- y is the target/label for each example

- prior_mu and prior_sigma define the prior distribution over the weights w, which is assumed to be a multivariate normal with mean prior_mu (all zeros) and covariance prior_sigma (identity matrix)

- logistic() defines the logistic sigmoid function used in logistic regression

- likelihood() calculates the likelihood of the data given weights w. It computes the predictions using X and w, calculates the log likelihood, and sums over all examples

- To sample from the posterior, we iteratively draw N=1000 samples from the prior distribution. Each sample is a 2D weight vector.

- The samples are plotted as blue points, with w1 on the x-axis and w2 on the y-axis.

- This visualizes the learned posterior distribution over the weights after seeing the data. Points cluster in high likelihood regions as defined by the data and prior.

So in summary, it implements Bayesian logistic regression by defining a prior, calculating the likelihood, and sampling from the posterior to visualize the learned weight distributions after accounting for both prior and data.
